# Design Tokens

Design tokens are the visual atoms of a design system, they are named entities that store a visual design attribute. They are basically variables that we use in place of hard-coded values.

All our design tokens are stored in CSS custom properties and they are made up of the following:

- Typography
- colors
- heights
- spacing

For more information on each of the above see the individual file

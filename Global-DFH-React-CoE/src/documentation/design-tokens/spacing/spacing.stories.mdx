# Design Token - Spacing

Spacing is an important aspect of creating a user centric application and oftern overlooked. Spacing helps create a consistent rhythm and constrain decision making.

The spacing system is based on using the line height as the default base which we then use multiple of this value for the varying measurements.

All of the spacing values are stored as CSS custom properties and use REMs as the unit:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Spacing">
    <Spacing />
  </Story>
</Preview>
